A project for the course:"Tecnologie e Software per il Web" at the University of Salerno.
This project consists in creating an e-commerce with the MVC Model.
So i decide to create an e-commerce for a comics shop.
In this webapp you can buy comics, action figures and also collectible cards.
3 tipe of user:
Non logged-in User: he can see al the stuf the webapp sels and also put theme in the cart but he can't buy them.
Logged in User: he can buy the products, and also use the function of the wishlist, and also he have access to his profile page.
Admin User: he can controll everything from his dedicated page.

The language i used for the creation of this webapp are:
1.Java: for the creation of the Servlets.
2.JSP: for the view of the webapp.
3.CSS: for the style of the pages.
4.Java Script: for change ste status of the DOM, and also AJAX for the search bar.

All the data of the webapp are strore in a local database:
For the creation of the database i used MySQL.
